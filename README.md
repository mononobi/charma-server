# Charma

Application for rapid and reliable movie collection management.
Charma is a personal movie collection manager, which can scan your computer for 
movies, identify movie files and download movie details from internet.

# Features

* it can scan your computer's hard disks for movie files, identify the movies 
  automatically, and download all basic details about each movie from internet, 
  and creates a local database of your movies collection.

* open the folder of the movie you desire, directly from the application. 
  you no more need to waste time by searching your computer for movies. 
  Charma lists all your movies at one place. you can add as many folders as you 
  like, and Charma is able to look for movie files inside those folders. 
  all the basic details about the movie will be downloaded and displayed 
  (such as director(s), actors, plot, IMDB rating, genres, etc). 
  The details are stored offline so that you don't need to connect to internet everytime.

* search for the title of movie, director, any of actors, genres, etc. 
  There is an intensive search area for you to work with.

* mark a movie as watched, and filter movies that are watched, or not watched, or all.

* sort movies according to title, year, IMDb rating, etc.

* mark a movie as favorite, so that you can keep a favorite list of movies in your collection.

* custom rate a movie out of 10, and store it.

* update movie information at any time with any details you want to be updated, all 
  from the internet without the need to manually enter a value.
  
* you can give a copy of your application to a friend. then he/she can make a request 
  list from your movies, and give the generated list to you (it's a simple text file). 
  then you load the list into your own application, and then automatically 
  copy all of those movies from your computer to an external device of your friend 
  without worrying about the real physical location of the movies on your hard 
  disk, sounds great? I think so.
  
 * when your movie collection grows by time, it's possible that you've been having 
   duplicate versions of the same movie.
   Charma lets you get a list of all duplicate movies and delete those that are 
   not needed to free up space on your hard disk.
   
 * when viewing a movie details, Charma shows you up to 20 relevant movies to 
   that movie according to genres and IMDB rate.
 
# Usage Notice

the only thing that you have to notice to use this app, is to not rename each 
movie's folder name after you've archived it using the app. otherwise, the link between 
the data stored in the app, and the real movie will be lost and if you insert that movie 
again, it will be inserted without notice.

# Hint

`Charma` is a greek word and means smashing, super.
